* What is SASS ?

=>  Syntatically Awesome Style Sheet
=>  Extension for CSS
=>  Skill for front-end devs.
=>  Preprocessor (you write code in syntax of SASS and using a compiler it turns into a css code)

* Why SASS ?

=>  Time saver
=>  Prevent a lot of errors
=>  Write clean & organized code
=>  Programming features (some things we can't do using pure css, or will take a lot of time, using features of programming will be able to do them easily)

* Features :

=>  Variables
=>  Functions
=>  Loops
=>  Extend (use features in a such class in somewhere else and add extra features on it: avoid repeating code)
=>  Control flow (if condition)
=>  Advanced structure (you can divide your project elements like header, side bar,... into separate files to have a well designed architecture of the project)

* When to start ?

=>  HTML
=>  CSS
=>  JAVASCRIPT
